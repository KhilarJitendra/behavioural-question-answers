(1) Tell me about yourself 

Hello, my name is Jitendra. I am a frontend engineer, and I enjoy working on complex problems. I like building user-friendly and efficient web applications.

I started my career by working on enterprise applications. During that time, I was responsible for frontend features, 
which helped me understand how to build stable and reliable applications for production use.

Over time, I realized that frontend development is the area I want to focus on. Since then, I have been working mainly with React and Next.js.

In my current role, I work closely with designers and backend engineers, and I take ownership of frontend features from design to production. 
At present, I am working on migrating the checkout process to improve performance on latest tech stack like Next JS Express JS Commetcetool 


I like taking ownership of my work, learning continuously, and building frontend systems that scale well as products grow. 
 
I believe my experience and interest in frontend development make me a good fit for this role.


(2) Your Current Role & Typical Day ?

In my current role, my day usually starts with the daily Scrum meeting. In the Scrum call, we discuss what was completed yesterday, what we are planning to do today, and if there are any blockers.

After Scrum, I usually start working on my assigned tasks. This includes developing new frontend features, fixing bugs, or working on ongoing initiatives like checkout migration.

I also spend time reviewing merge requests from other team members. While reviewing MRs, I focus on code quality, performance, readability, and making sure best practices are followed.

I regularly mentor junior developers by helping them understand requirements, reviewing their code, and guiding them on better implementation approaches.

During the day, I also attend calls with clients, designers, or backend teams to discuss requirements, clarify doubts, and provide updates on progress.

Towards the end of the day, I usually check the status of tasks, respond to messages, and plan the next steps for the following day.
