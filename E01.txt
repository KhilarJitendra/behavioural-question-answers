(1) Tell me about yourself 

Hello, my name is Jitendra. I am a frontend engineer, and I enjoy working on complex problems. I like building user-friendly and efficient web applications.

I started my career by working on enterprise applications. During that time, I was responsible for frontend features, 
which helped me understand how to build stable and reliable applications for production use.

Over time, I realized that frontend development is the area I want to focus on. Since then, I have been working mainly with React and Next.js.

In my current role, I work closely with designers and backend engineers, and I take ownership of frontend features from design to production. 
At present, I am working on migrating the checkout process to improve performance on latest tech stack like Next JS Express JS Commetcetool 


I like taking ownership of my work, learning continuously, and building frontend systems that scale well as products grow. 
 
I believe my experience and interest in frontend development make me a good fit for this role.


(2) Your Current Role & Typical Day ?

In my current role, my day usually starts with the daily Scrum meeting. In the Scrum call, we discuss what was completed yesterday, what we are planning to do today, and if there are any blockers.

After Scrum, I usually start working on my assigned tasks. This includes developing new frontend features, fixing bugs, or working on ongoing initiatives like checkout migration.

I also spend time reviewing merge requests from other team members. While reviewing MRs, I focus on code quality, performance, readability, and making sure best practices are followed.

I regularly mentor junior developers by helping them understand requirements, reviewing their code, and guiding them on better implementation approaches.

During the day, I also attend calls with clients, designers, or backend teams to discuss requirements, clarify doubts, and provide updates on progress.

Towards the end of the day, I usually check the status of tasks, respond to messages, and plan the next steps for the following day.

(3) Challenging Recent Task ?

Topic: Address management in checkout (VCA project)

Situation:
In the Van Cleef & Arpels e-commerce project, the checkout flow had issues with address handling. 
Different countries had different address formats, and this was causing validation errors and user drop-offs during checkout.

Task:
My task was to fix and improve the address management part of the checkout, so that it worked correctly for multiple countries and was easy to maintain.

Action:
I refactored the address form into a reusable React component and moved country-specific validation logic into a custom hook.
I worked with the backend team to clearly understand required fields for each country.
I also added proper error handling and updated E2E tests to cover different address scenarios.

Result:
After this change, address-related checkout issues reduced significantly.
The code became easier to maintain, and adding support for new countries became faster and safer.

Tech - 

From a production point of view in Next.js, I separated the address form UI into a reusable React component, moved country-specific validation into a custom hook using config-based rules, 
coordinated with backend teams to align on required fields, ensured final validation on the server, and added E2E tests to safely handle multiple country address scenarios.
